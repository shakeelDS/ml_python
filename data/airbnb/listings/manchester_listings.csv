2 & 3. I also manage a self-contained 1-bedroom apartment in the City Centre, and a self-contained 2-bedroom house in Salford, both of which you can book for your exclusive use. You'll still get my personal service with booking and check-in and I'll be available if you have any problems. 

4. I also manage the bookings for a private room in a large & beautiful house in Whalley Range. Georgia is the homeowner and lives in the property - I will deal with your enquiries and booking arrangements, but during your stay you'll be sharing the space with Georgia and her friendly cats.

Here are some other things that make me joyful: my sons; music; reading; the sounds of the African night; beautiful old churches; laughing; star-gazing; hearing my Dad whistling in his garden; sushi; writing; my funny dog; mountains; dancing; macadamia nuts; the sea; going to gigs and festivals; making things; arthouse cinema; playing Scrabble; passion fruit; animals small and large; stained glass windows; falling snow; riding very fast on horseback with the wind in my face; camping in the middle of nowhere; the sound of birds singing and little children laughing.

I have been using Airbnb for a couple of years now and have met some lovely people along the way.  I have used it both here at home when away for weekends with friends or walking my dog; as well as abroad.

I live in Manchester with my little dog Ruby; a rescue dog I adopted last summer, she's a gorgeous Staffordshire bull terrier.  We live in South Manchester in Chorlton, one of Manchesters hippest districts, a lovely laid back and arty place.

I love music, live gigs and festivals but my biggest passion is travelling.  I have travelled quite extensively in the past, I love to visit places that are a world away from what I am used to at home, I love learning about different cultures.  I have a close affinity to Spain having lived and worked there in the past and still visit regularly to see friends and my little godson Santiago.

I consider myself to be a very open and positive person with a thirst for life and believe your life is what you make it.  Its all out there waiting you.. just have to go and get it..!!

We are confident and outgoing individuals that embrace new experiences. Road trips to different cities are great and we also recently went to Amsterdam, which was awesome. We love adventures as well as spending quality time together, watching TV on the sofa.

We are secretly geeky, with a love of sci-fi movies and Doctor Who. We do, however, love to party as well. If we're heading on a night out, it will be somewhere playing House or Electro tunes. We can be found in a quiet bar doing a pub quiz, or in a mega club, dancing all night. We're pretty easy going when it comes to a fun night out and we're happy to try new venues or music styles.

I came here for university and liked it so much I've stayed for over twenty years. I know a fair bit about the local history of Manchester, I enjoy cooking and entertaining, knitting, theatre and music, and especially singing with my acappella choir! 

I'm gay (so no homophobes please!) a bit 'leftie' and fond of wine & cats.

I've had guests staying from all over the world - feel free to browse my reviews - and really enjoy helping people discover Manchester, which is a great city to live in with loads going on all through the year. 

I manage 4 listings, each with their own unique character:

1. If you're interested in staying with me in the private room in my own home, I will ask you to tell me a bit about yourself and your trip, and I will do my best to answer any questions you have. It's very relaxed at my house - you'll have your own key and be able to come and go as you please. Let me know how I can make your visit memorable.

2 & 3. I also manage a self-contained 1-bedroom apartment in the City Centre, and a self-contained 2-bedroom house in Salford, both of which you can book for your exclusive use. You'll still get my personal service with booking and check-in and I'll be available if you have any problems. 

4. I also manage the bookings for a private room in a large & beautiful house in Whalley Range. Georgia is the homeowner and lives in the property - I will deal with your enquiries and booking arrangements, but during your stay you'll be sharing the space with Georgia and her friendly cats.

Beech Road is a beautiful cafe strip. A little further on is Burton Road and Didsbury which can be found on the same tram line as Chorlton so is quick to get to, but can be walked if you're feeling energetic. Burton Road is home to Rose Garden and Greens - two amazing restaurants, better I'd say than many in the city centre.

She loves people and is very friendly (except to the postman...) but won't be licking your face or pestering you. Sometimes we also have our darling former foster dog, Gussie (also a little terrier) with us - for a day visit or holidays when his new family are away. The dogs are not allowed upstairs or in guest rooms, so you won't need to worry that you will return to find a little hairy friend trotting around in your room or curled up in your bed. **B) Please note that I'm afraid the kitchen is not available for guests to use for cooking or preparing meals - unless you are here as a long-term guest (10 days or more).

Home to media types, musicians, young professionals and young families it's a very nice neighbourhood to be in. West Didsbury particularly is a little more independent than East with a strip of independent bars/shops/restaurants just a 5 minute walk away. You won't be short of places to eat and drink and we can certainly recommend our favourite spots! You will be staying right on the historic Lapwing Lane arcade which has a Pizza Express/Post Office/Pharmacy/Deli/General store and Wine Bar! The Fletcher Moss botanical gardens are a short bus ride away and also a large entertainment centre (cinema/bowling/casino) is a 5 minute tram ride away. Getting to the city centre is incredibly easy through public transport and there you will find a huge amount of museums/shops/music venues & theatres to explore to your heart's content. We can help with suggestions for wherever your interests lie :)","As I live along an arcade of shops my next door neighbour is a (fabulous!) wine bar. From time to time there will be a little noise from them but I will endeavour to let guests know when to expect a little more noise (the usual Friday/Saturday, however they are only open until midnight)","The flat is incredibly well positioned for transport.  The West Didsbury tram stop is across the road which connects you to all of Greater Manchester, 15 minutes to Trafford Bar (for Old Trafford) and 25 minutes to the centre.

I'm Marco. I'm originally from Sydney Australia and moved to Manchester with work about 18 months ago. I'm a project manager in the power generation industry.  I live with my partner Jacinta, a lawyer, and our Spaniel dog, Dexter in West Didsbury. 

We love to travel and explore, eat out and, when we're feeling healthy, go to yoga and pilates classes. I really enjoy cycling and music - I play the guitar, although not as well as I would like to! 

We both love meeting new people and learning about different cultures. We were lucky enough to have an amazing 4 month trip last year to a real mix of countries including Iran, Mongolia, Japan and Thailand.

Some friends and I tried AirBnB for a trip and were surprised at how easy the service was to use, and the quality of the apartment we rented.

To this end, I thought I'd give it a shot and let my old home via AirBnB, providing the same level of service we enjoyed on our trip.

I'm sure you'll love the house as we did for 12 years, and still do!

The camera bit didn't really work out as I spend most of my time keeping house and looking after our wonderful guests. Christine works in admin. We live in a largish Edwardian semi. We are a very sociable couple and we enjoy the social life in our community. When she is not out at work Christine is the nice one who makes cakes, bakes bread and makes our guests feel relaxed and welcome. I do most of the meeting and greeting, preparing our guest rooms, fixing breakfasts, researching local information and all the other little bits and pieces that help to make your stay memorable and enjoyable.

We both love cooking (and eating) and we enjoy preparing food for, and dining with, our guests. We try to remove processed foods from our diet as much as possible and we follow the same ethos when catering for our guests. Most of the foodstuffs we use for breakfast are home made. The meals that we provide in the evening are all cooked from fresh ingredients.

Guests seem to enjoy our house. Our house is clean but It is certainly not the tidiest house you will have seen. There are usually a few bits of clutter lying around. Books, newspapers and grandchildren's art work are often sprinkled around the place. I always tell Christine that a bit of clutter adds atmosphere to a home.

You will have access to the entire flat, the yard and entrance is shared with another neighbour but the flat will be yours for your stay. I should be there on arrival to show you around and help with any questions you might have about Manchester/the flat :) I will let you know when booking. Didsbury is one of the hottest neighbourhoods in Manchester. Home to media types, musicians, young professi",none,"Didsbury is one of the hottest neighbourhoods in Manchester. Home to media types, musicians, young professionals and young families it's a very nice neighbourhood to be in! West Didsbury particularly is a little more independent than East with a strip of independent bars/shops/restaurants just a 5 minute walk away. You won't be short of places to eat and drink and I can certainly recommend my favourite spots! You will be staying right on the historic Lapwing Lane arcade which has a Pizza Express/Post Office/Pharmacy/Deli/General store and Wine Bar! The Fletcher Moss botanical gardens are a short bus ride away and also a large entertainment centre (cinema/bowling/casino) is a 5 minute tram ride away. Getting to the city centre is incredibly easy through public transport and there you will find a huge amount of museums/shops/music venues & theatres to explore to your heart's content. I can help with suggestions for wherever your interests lie :)","The flat is located next to a bar (which won CityLife Best Bar in Manchester 2015! So highly recommended!) so inevitably noise comes through from time to time, weekend evenings mainly. They do however stop serving at midnight so noise should stop shortly after. It's worth taking this into consideration if you like an early nights sleep on a weekend, however most guests haven't found it to be a problem.","The flat is incredibly well positioned for transport.  The West Didsbury tram stop is across the road which connects you to all of Greater Manchester, 15 minutes to Trafford Bar (for Old Trafford) and 25 minutes to the centre.  Buses run from outside the flat and round the corner to Universities/city centre (£1 single/20mins to uni/25mins to town) and also the 24hr airport bus (no.43) can be found within a 3 minute walk of the flat.  Taxis to/from the airport should cost around £12. There is parking directly outside but it is limited to 2 hours between 8am and 6pm, however on street parking can be found in the street behind the flat easily :)",https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff7ba29e-c3f1-4c81-97c9-610c471f1755.jpg?aki_policy=small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff7ba29e-c3f1-4c81-97c9-610c471f1755.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff7ba29e-c3f1-4c81-97c9-610c471f1755.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/ff7ba29e-c3f1-4c81-97c9-610c471f1755.jpg?aki_policy=x_large,6478345,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/6478345,Jemma,2013-05-20,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",Hello!

We love having friends and family to stay and would like to extend this welcome to people looking to explore Manchester, or simply stopping over for the night. 
Manchester is a great city, Jill grew up here and I moved up here in 2010. We can give you pointers on good places to go for food and drink, how to get around and some of the most popular sights. 
Chorlton is 4 miles to the south of the city centre. It is a really vibrant local community with more pubs, cafes and independent deli's than you could know what to do with! If you're an ale drinker then you could definitely pass a few happy evenings in one of our locals! We enjoy going for walks in the Peak District with our dog Willow, sampling local beers with friends in the pubs and cafés of Chorlton and relaxing at home with Willow and our cat Mavis.
We've both done lots of traveling in India, Australia, Kenya, Costa Rica, USA and Europe and want to do much more; the Northern Lights and Argentina are high up on the list! Because of this we thought it'd be fun to open our house up other to other travelers no matter how long or short your trip.

The Northern Quarter is famed for its independent shops and boutiques, where you can pick up designer or retro clothes, rare  vinyl's, collectable comics, unusual furniture and superb art.  Today it is equally famed for its social scene, with the beautiful restaurants, cool bars, quirky coffee shops and city spas, pulling many young professionals to live in the beautiful old buildings that line the streets. The joy of the Northern Quarter is that it provides a central base to explore the whole of the city and beyond.   You will find lots of shops and the central hub of shopping in the Arndale centre. Or if you are after something a bit more unconventional, check out Afflecks Palace an “emporium of eclecticism"" which is a 5 minute walk away.

It takes 14 minutes to walk from Manchester Piccadilly, an easy walk, unless you have heavy luggage and need to jump in a cab. Free bus service – Outside Piccadilly Station on Station Approach is the bus stops for all the free city centre buses. They cover a huge area, they are reliable and regular and best of all they are free, so use them!  Buses – Buses can be caught from Piccadilly gardens.  Tram – Trams can also be caught from Piccadilly gardens.  Taxis – 5 minutes away just outside a large department store called Debenhams is a  taxi rank allowing you to get out and about quickly if you're in a rush, or to prevent a drenching in the rain if heading to another part of town.  Manchester is not a big place and you can walk to the other side of the City in 20mins, unless taking a leisurely pace, which can be quicker than a cab in rush hour.

We're an early 30s couple in Manchester who love the city and all it has to offer both culturally and for a tipple on a friday night.

We have owned our apartment for 8 years and have only recently listed it on AirBnB but we're already enjoying the social aspect of having people come and stay. We really take pride in people having a nice experience when they come to visit the city!

Aside from this, we both enjoy yoga and host retreats over in Ibiza now and then with our company called Retreat My Soul. We're also lovers of interiors and very much enjoy popping off to other AirBnB properties around the country / world to soak up some unfamiliar territory and see what experiences we can get involved with.

As a host you will find us extremely helpful, willing to ensure your stay in our home is as good as it can be.

As guests you will find us respectful and with a smile on our faces - we just came back from tenerife just yesterday where we enjoyed a fabulous stay in an AirBnB apartment in Playa Paraiso.

Returning to live here after some years away I've moved to a completely new area and have made some great friends here. I love meeting new people and have enjoyed hosting with my ex partner in my apartment for which we received some fantastic reviews since I pride myself on guests having a lovely stay.

I have a few passions, such as climbing, cooking and watching films. I spend time going to comedy gigs and the theatre or walking in the countryside. I enjoy peoples company when they have visited my place in the past and have prepared meals for a few of the guests while they were visiting, as a kind of culinary cultural exchange! I used to co host on this site but since we have gone our separate ways I have set up my own profile. This should give you some idea of what to expect room wise and certainly reviews too.

I'm very relaxed and happy to leave people to their own devices should that be what you want and excited to meet all the guests I will hopefully host. I'm more than happy to offer advice on the nice places to eat and hidden gems of Manchester that very few tourists see or hear about as local knowledge goes a long way! Always happy to help make your stay here as pleasant as possible so feel free to ask me anything, including if discounts are available for longer stays ;)

I aim to make my guests' experience as enjoyable as possible and provide loads of info on the area and extra touches.

I do require guests to be fully validated before accepting their requests and would like to hear a bit about you and your reason for visiting when you contact me.

My name is Joanne, and I have lived in Manchester for most of my life, and I love the city for what it has to offer...there is always a new restaurant opening to try or a new band playing. I'm happy to have found Airbnb to help travellers from round the world or even within the UK discover Manchester! 
When I can afford to travel myself I love the water, so anything near the sea so I can go scuba diving, fantastic.
Guests keep commenting on how wonderful the bed is, so I think thats great to hear, I like to think my place is somewhere nice to rest weary bodies!

I'm Valerio (originally from Italy), Manchester is now my surrogate home. I work in academia and am finishing a PhD within the Economics field. It's commonplace for my research to take me out of the country which means my home is sitting empty and I would therefore like others to enjoy it as much as I do. 

I'm very passionate about food and travel and love to explore new places all the time.

When hosting, I would like for guests to feel welcome and at home, and to fully enjoy their time in this fair (if sometimes rainy) city of Manchester. But don't let a little shower put you off - it really is an incredible place to be! 

""The thing is, it all comes from here."" Noel Gallagher on Manchester

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. 

I hope to see you soon!

Valerio

I'm Dylan, originally from a small town of Brittany (France), I then, moved quite a lot. Moved to Sheffield (UK) for a few years before experiencing the Canadian life in Toronto for another few years. I finally decided to move back closer to my roots and settled in Manchester.

I personally enjoyed meeting people from all over the world and learned a lot about cultures in different countries.

I practice different kind of sports, but Football is what I play the most (huge fan of Olympique de Marseille for those who have any idea about the French Ligue 1). 
I also play Tennis, Squash... I run a lot too. I heard it's the best way to keep in shape.

Anyway, I'm really easy going and I'm sure we'll get along. I'm also really available in case you'd need any help to find your way around the city or would like to know the ""places to be"" in Manchester.

I'm quite a sociable person and  love going to music events, but prefer the small more intimate venue, of which there are plenty in Manchester. I have an eclectic music taste, but if I had to choose I would say reggae, soul and  funk are my favourites. I love eating out, and visiting  Manchester diverse range of restaurants. I'm also into meditation, and try and meditate most days. I'm active in my community and  a member of the local residents group.

I decided to become host after hosting for local language students studying nearby.  I genuinely enjoy sharing my home, and meeting and hearing about other people's experience and ways of life.  My language students described me as their English mum, however as much as I will take care of you I also know when someone wants to be left alone. I have also stayed as a guest on Airbnb in Berlin, my exceptional host made all the difference to my holiday.
My eldest daughter has travelled extensively, so my approach to hosting is to  treat my guests just how I  would expect my  daughter to be treated when she travels far and wide - with love, respect and TLC.

Really excited about hosting people in my lovely home I share with Oscar, my wonderful dog.

Things I really like are; Spotify, walking the dog, vinyasa yoga, my job, meeting new people and eating out!

Things I couldn't live without are, my friends, exercise, good chocolate, coffee and of course my family including Oscar.

My favourite places to visit have been, Manchester of course, Mumbai, Tokyo, Barcelona, Ghent and Antwerp and Glasgow. All amazing places.

My favourite food  is really difficult, love eating everything. Really like Indian, Lebanese, Vietnamese and Italian. I wish every meal was Ice cream.

My favourite music is also very difficult to answer, I love everything from classical to pop. Currently listening to Sia and Portland Street Cello Project.

My favourite aspect of being a host is getting to share my home with new people and being a good host. I like to meet independently minded people who prefer to stay in home rather than hotel. My travelling experiences involve luxury to hostelling to couch surfing all very enjoyable. I like to travel to places to feel the real city rather than just the brochure. 

For a profession I'm a lecturer at a University in Geography Education so I'm well experienced to point you in the right direction to explore the great city of Manchester! What's my life motto.... Don't believe in luck alone!

The constant chattering of trains and trams overhead forms a backdrop to the dominant silhouette of Beetham Tower. The 47-storey building is the tallest in the city by some distance. Visitors find the building particularly handy; it's difficult to get too lost when you have a 171-metre monolith to use as a reference point – it even used to hum tunes on a windy day.  Once a hub of industrial activity, Castlefield is now one of the city's most tranquil spots.

As a host
I live in a lovely house with housemate Tom.  He's a musician and I'm in the creative sector, so between us we have plenty of tips about where to go and what to see.  We are always interested to meet new people and are happy to spend as much - or as little - time with you as you would like.  We both know the ins and outs of Manchester and will gladly help out with a bit of local knowledge.

The house has plenty of ornaments and stuff I've collected over the years (You've noticed the mermaid tail in the pictures, I suspect!) including some offensive crockery.  It's not a 'showroom' house, but we do try to keep things tidy.  We hope you'll feel comfortable and warm whilst you stay with us :)

It's quite strange, before moving to Manchester I had never felt a sense of civic pride about a place, in fact I'd argue that to feel emotion towards geography would be quite absurd—yet since moving here for University a few years ago I have found myself flying the Mancunian flag in arguments amongst friends, defending its heritage and waxing lyrical about its musical contributions to the world. Big enough to keep your interest, always have something to capture your imagination and take you by surprise and yet also somehow small enough to feel welcoming and personal. I feel very fortunate to live in Manchester, the centre of the universe.","","Lots of regular transport options are available: busses down Oxford Road; trains to Manchester Piccadilly; Metrolink trams; and the airport just a stone's throw away, all make getting around incredibly easy. I suggest you use the CityMapper app to navigate your way around our brilliant local public transport system, or Uber if you're in need of a taxi.

I love meeting new people and have enjoyed hosting with my ex partner in my apartment for which we received some fantastic reviews since I pride myself on guests having a lovely stay.

I have a few passions, such as climbing, cooking and watching films. I spend time going to comedy gigs and the theatre or walking in the countryside. I enjoy peoples company when they have visited my place in the past and have prepared meals for a few of the guests while they were visiting, as a kind of culinary cultural exchange! I used to co host on this site but since we have gone our separate ways I have set up my own profile. This should give you some idea of what to expect room wise and certainly reviews too.

I'm very relaxed and happy to leave people to their own devices should that be what you want and excited to meet all the guests I will hopefully host. I'm more than happy to offer advice on the nice places to eat and hidden gems of Manchester that very few tourists see or hear about as local knowledge goes a long way! Always happy to help make your stay here as pleasant as possible so feel free to ask me anything, including if discounts are available for longer stays ;)

Today it is equally famed for its social scene, with the beautiful restaurants, cool bars, quirky coffee shops and city spas, pulling many young professionals to live in the beautiful old buildings that line the streets. The joy of the Northern Quarter is that it provides a central base to explore the whole of the city and beyond.   You will find lots of shops and the central hub of shopping in the Arndale centre.

The University of Manchester and MMU are about twenty minutes walk, Salford University is about twenty five minutes walk. There are regular buses (including a free bus to Salford Uni) available to all of the universities too. The area is really lovely and hugely convenient - I'd be happy to help with suggestions on how to enjoy the best bits.","","There is a bus stop as you step out of the flat building, the tram stop is about five minutes walk away and Manchester Piccadilly and Victoria are both about ten minutes walk away.

The country that makes us want to quit our jobs, pack our bags and just forget about everything is definitely Iceland (having visited there twice!).

The apartment couldn't be better placed to suit the Manchester visitor or regular business traveller.  Malmaisson, Hilton Doubletree, Premier Inn, Max apartments and Abode Hotel are within 200 yards of Ducie Wharf, paying testament to its location. It takes 3 mins to walk from Manchester Piccadilly allowing quick access from the train station, easy even with heavy luggage.   At the end of the road is a large taxi rank allowing you to get out and about quickly if you're in a rush, or to prevent a drenching in the rain if heading to another part of town.  Manchester is not a big place and you can walk to the other side of the City in 20mins, unless taking a leisurely pace, which can be quicker than a cab in rush hour.  Further along is a 24-hour Spar and Tesco meaning you're never more than a few minutes away from anything you need. The apartment is 5 mins walk to Northern Quarter, Canal Street with Deansgate and Spinningfields being 10 minutes away.  Literally 15","A few minor points for the bathroom. For the sink plug it is manual, there is no lever to release it. The bathroom door handle is very stiff , please be gentle when shutting the door.","MORE ON GETTING OUT AND ABOUT ….. The apartment could not be better located. Some hints and tips for getting about; - Taxis - walk out of the apartment back down Ducie Street (turn left out of Junction House, left again) and when you come to the cross roads with Cafe Nero and Malmaisson, you'll see a cab rank opposite Malmaisson. - Free Bus Service – Outside Piccadilly Station on Station Approach is the bus stops for all the free city centre busses. They cover a huge area, they are reliable and regular and best of all they are free, so use them! - Supermarket - further along from the taxi rank, there is a 24hr Spar, 24 Hour Tesco (opposite the spar), Greggs, 2 or 3 mainstream bars, Fatso's for sandwiches.  A little further down is Piccadilly Gardens with banks, restaurants, shops etc. If you have a particular destination (football stadiums, museums, theatres, neighbourhoods for going out like Northern Quarter, Spinningfields, Canal Street, Deansgate Locks etc), or any question not cove",https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/6c97181f-a911-4488-a295-8de28369d525.jpg?aki_policy=small,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/6c97181f-a911-4488-a295-8de28369d525.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/6c97181f-a911-4488-a295-8de28369d525.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/6c97181f-a911-4488-a295-8de28369d525.jpg?aki_policy=x_large,6413143,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/6413143,Claire,2013-05-15,United Kingdom,"Mummy of two little boys - my husband and I remember the days we travelled far and wide before they arrived.

I came here for university and liked it so much I've stayed for over twenty years. I know a fair bit about the local history of Manchester, I enjoy cooking and entertaining, knitting, theatre and music, and especially singing with my acappella choir! 

I'm gay (so no homophobes please!) a bit 'leftie' and fond of wine & cats.

I've had guests staying from all over the world - feel free to browse my reviews - and really enjoy helping people discover Manchester, which is a great city to live in with loads going on all through the year. 

I manage 4 listings, each with their own unique character:

1. If you're interested in staying with me in the private room in my own home, I will ask you to tell me a bit about yourself and your trip, and I will do my best to answer any questions you have. It's very relaxed at my house - you'll have your own key and be able to come and go as you please. Let me know how I can make your visit memorable.

2 & 3. I also manage a self-contained 1-bedroom apartment in the City Centre, and a self-contained 2-bedroom house in Salford, both of which you can book for your exclusive use. You'll still get my personal service with booking and check-in and I'll be available if you have any problems. 

4. I also manage the bookings for a private room in a large & beautiful house in Whalley Range. Georgia is the homeowner and lives in the property - I will deal with your enquiries and booking arrangements, but during your stay you'll be sharing the space with Georgia and her friendly cats.

The apartment couldn't be better placed to suit the Manchester visitor or regular business traveller.  Malmaisson, Hilton Doubletree, Premier Inn, Max apartments and Abode Hotel are within 200 yards of Ducie Wharf, paying testament to its location. It takes 3 mins to walk from Manchester Piccadilly allowing quick access from the train station, easy even with heavy luggage.   At the end of the road is a large taxi rank allowing you to get out and about quickly if you're in a rush, or to prevent a drenching in the rain if heading to another part of town.  Manchester is not a big place and you can walk to the other side of the City in 20mins, unless taking a leisurely pace, which can be quicker than a cab in rush hour.

The apartment is 5 mins walk to Northern Quarter, Canal Street with Deansgate and Spinningfields being 10 minutes away.  Literally 15","","MORE ON GETTING OUT AND ABOUT ….. The apartment could not be better located.
