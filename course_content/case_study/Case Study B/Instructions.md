# Case Study B

In this case study you will walk through an extended case study exploring the titanic data set.

This is a slightly different version of the data set used previously - with more features included.

The workbooks give code which will help you complete the tasks.

This case study focuses on feature engineering - something covered only lightly in the main course.

## Instructions

Within "/Case Study B/notebooks/workbooks" complete:

* 1_titanic_EDA.ipynb
* 2_titanic_train.ipynb
* 3_titanic_engineered.ipynb
* 4_logreg_tune.ipynb

After each work book check the answers in the corresponding "/Case Study B/notebooks/answers" folder.

This case study is more prescriptive than the previous - showing a more in depth process for exploring and engineering the data.

Doing so helps boost the performance of the resulting model.
